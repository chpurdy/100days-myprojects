## VSCode Editor Tricks Learned

* ctrl-shift-alt-numpad down = duplicate current line (or selection)
* VSCode has a ton of autocomplete stuff for `style=` 
* VSCode will autocomplete images if they are there...very cool.

## HTML Stuff Learned
* I understand `div` tags now!  Wow, how simple.  
* Use `<strong>` for bold.
* Use `<input type=password>` for password fields
* Add the `required` keyword to an input if it is required
